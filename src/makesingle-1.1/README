I change the script again, some study from gzexe's script.
This version is more simple and easy use.
--------------
Finally, I got the first version, this is works great.

Let me introduce what is "makeself".
This a great tool, and open source in the network. Works great too.

I do it because I found "makeself" does't work well with me.
It output a some prompt which I don't want it, do not clean file in the current directory.
So I did it myself. Program is small and powerful.
Spend nearly two hours. But works really fine. ^_^

Dependency:
	sed tail echo ls tr tar cat mktemp dirname
